# Stray-Tracker
An application that helps communities keep track of the strays in the area.

# Why
If you are anything like me, it means you take care of the animals that live wildly in your neighborhood. I have a number of cats that I feed, pet and check on daily. On the days I don't see them, I tend to get worried. This application will allow others in your community to share their sightings and experiences with specific animals.

# How
You will be able to create profiles with pictures and information regarding the cat, and when someone sees the animal they simply 'mark' the animal's location with a pin on a map. There will be a time stamp, so others can see when and where the animal last was seen, or reported.
